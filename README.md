# People

Please feel free to add yourself to the [people.tsv][] file if you've come to a meetup.

The first column is for your GitHub username and is required. The second column is for your ID in [Zulip](https://osdc.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/406743-boston) and is optional.

Suggestions and pull requests are welcome, of course! 😄

`run.sh` will spin up a dev environment at <http://localhost:8080/people/>
